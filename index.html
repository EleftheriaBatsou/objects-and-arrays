<h4> Javascript references vs copies</h4>
<p>Psst! Open console!</p>

  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
	let age = 100;
	let age2 = age;
	console.log(age, age2);
	age = 200;
	console.log(age, age2);
	
	let name = 'ele'
	let name2 = name;
	console.log(name, name2);
	name = 'elefth';
	console.log(name, name2);
	
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
	const team = players;
	
	console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
	//team[3] = 'Lux' //team is the reference
	
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
	const team2 = players.slice(); //copy of the actuall array

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
	const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
	const team4 = [...players];
	team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';
	console.log(team4);
	
	const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
	const person = {
	name: 'elef bat',
	age: 80
	};

    // and think we make a copy:
	//const captain = person;
	//captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
	const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age: 12});
	console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
	const cap3 = {...person};
	
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
	
	const elef = {
		name: 'wes';
		age : 100;
		social: {
			twitter: '@Batsou',
			facebook: 'eleft.elef'
		}
	};
	
	console.clear();
	console.log(elef);
	
	const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); //only one level dev, which means twiiter, fb wan't changed
	
	const dev2  = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(elef));
